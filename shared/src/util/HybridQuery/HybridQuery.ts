     * **Purpose — reduce the in-memory (JS heap) footprint.** A live query holds its
     * entire result window resident in `output` for as long as the consumer is
     * mounted, and a `live` query re-materialises it on every change. When a doc type

     * revision token — those fields can dominate the retained size of a big window.
     * Listing them here keeps them out of the heap entirely: each doc is shallow-
     * copied without them at ingest, so the originals are freed and only the slim
     * copies are retained. The win scales with window size and field weight; for a
     * doc whose listed fields are absent the copy is skipped, so a no-op costs
     * nothing. Strip only fields the rendered output genuinely does not read — a
     * stripped field is simply not present on `output` docs.

     * **Relationship to the cache.** Because stripped docs are what `output` holds,
     * they are also what the response cache persists — so `stripFields` shrinks the
     * cache footprint too. {@link cacheStripFields} is the narrower tool: it removes
     * *additional* fields from the cache **only**, leaving them in `output`.
     *
     * **Safety.** The merge / sort / dedup / live-update machinery reads only `_id`
     * and `updatedTimeUtc`, so stripping any other field is correctness-neutral —
     * but never strip those two. {@link persistOffline} is unaffected: the full,

 * per query. Most callers should use the {@link useHybridQuery} composable, which
 * constructs this class and returns just `output`; construct the class directly
 * only when you need a manual `dispose()` handle.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const q = new HybridQuery<ContentDto>({
 *     selector: { ... },
 *     $sort: [{ publishDate: "desc" }],
 *     $limit: 10,
 * });
 * // template binds to q.output.value
 * // q.dispose() runs automatically on component unmount when constructed
 * // inside a Vue effect scope (<script setup>); call it manually otherwise.
 * //
 * // Pass { live: true } to keep BOTH sources reactive: the local Dexie source
 * // (re-emits on every IndexedDB change) and the remote supplement (Socket.io
 * // live updates). The default is one-shot.
 * ```
 *
 * **Reactive queries (dependency tracking).** A `() => MangoQuery` **thunk** is
 * reactive — read `ref.value` directly inside it and the query rebuilds when any
 * ref it reads changes. This is **independent of `live`**: the thunk decides *when
 * the query is rebuilt*; `live` decides *how the data stays fresh*.
 *
 * | query form | `live: false` (one-shot) | `live: true` |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | static `MangoQuery` | read once | live Dexie + socket; **query fixed** |
 * | `() => MangoQuery` thunk | **re-query on each dep change** (snapshot) | live **+ dependency tracking** |
 *
 * The refs the thunk reads are auto-tracked (no `deps` array; a serialized-query
 * compare dedupes no-op changes). Each dep change rebuilds the local read, and (in
 * live mode) the API POST + socket predicates, discarding in-flight POSTs from the
 * previous query. In **one-shot** mode a thunk re-queries on each change but is a
 * snapshot between changes (no liveQuery/socket). `output` is kept across a rebuild
 * (no flash) unless the new query is provably-empty. The thunk must be **pure** (it
 * is called more than once per change). See the README "Reactive queries" section.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // reactive: rebuilds whenever pinnedCats changes
 * const q = new HybridQuery<ContentDto>(
 *     () => ({ selector: { parentTags: { $elemMatch: { $in: pinnedCats.value } } } }),
 *     { live: true },
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Core invariant:** the newest content is always present locally — sync
 * maintains the head of the timeline. The API is only ever needed to supply
 * data that is genuinely not local: older content (`publishDate <= cutoff`),
 * specific missing ids, or non-synced doc types. Every short-circuit in this
 * class (limit satisfied locally, all ids present locally) and the
 * `publishDate <= cutoff` clauses are correct because of this invariant.
 *
 * **Routing:**
 * - `type === "content"` (partially synced): read Dexie, then decide whether to
 *   supplement from the API via {@link decideContentApiQuery}.
 * - Other types present in `syncList` (fully synced): Dexie only.
 * - Other types not in `syncList`: API only.
 *
 * **Merge semantics:** local + remote are unioned by `_id` with newer
 * `updatedTimeUtc` winning, then re-sorted and re-limited per the query's
 * `$sort`/`$limit`. UNION (not replace) is critical — the remote query may fetch
 * only the older tail, so fresh local docs above the cutoff must be retained.
 * `output` is only reassigned when the windowed result actually changed (compared
 * by `_id` + `updatedTimeUtc`), to avoid needless Vue re-renders.
 *
 * **Live mode (`{ live: true }`):** the local source is read via `useDexieLiveQuery`
 * (re-emits on every IndexedDB change), and the remote contribution is kept live by
 * a Socket.io listener that filters the global access-scoped changefeed with a
 * predicate compiled from the supplement query. The supplement POST stays one-shot;
 * reconnect only re-attaches the listener (no re-fetch). See the README for the
 * shortcomings (offline-gap healing, delete-predicate fidelity, tombstones).
 *
 * **Offline:** if `isConnected` is false when the supplement POST is needed, the
 * class watches the connection and fires it once it becomes true (run-once). The
 * watcher is registered for teardown on `dispose()`.
