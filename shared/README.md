# Luminary frontent shared library

This library contains essential building blocks for building a front-end application for the Luminary sync API

## Installation

```sh
npm install luminary-shared
```

_Note_

Installing this package as a local dependency (e.g. when cloning the parent mono-repo) does not work due to some issues with the underlying symlinks breaking the reactiveness of data passed from IndexedDB. The workaround is to install it from the NPM registery.
