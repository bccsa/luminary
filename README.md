## Name

lu·​mi·​nary - ˈlü-mə-ˌner-ē

1. a person of prominence or brilliant achievement
2. a body that gives light

## Folder structure

- `api`: API layer over CouchDB
- `app`: Web and native frontend app

## Architectural Decision Records

We record our decisions in the `docs/adr` folder. See the [first ADR](./docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) for more information on this process. You can install [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to manage ADRs locally, such as creating one with this command:

```sh
adr new Branching strategy
```
