# Luminary App

This is the frontend of the Luminary app. It's an offline-first Vue app that runs in the browser.

## Architecture (build-time plugins)

Cross-cutting services follow a **contract + injection key + build-time virtual module** pattern: Vite resolves each `virtual:…` id to an entry under **`src/build-time/plugins/<name>/`**, and **`src/build-time/contracts/plugin-registry.ts`** registers those services on the app. Feature code uses **`inject`** with keys from **`token.ts`** under **`src/build-time/contracts/`**, not direct imports of adapter code.

**Example in this repo:** the **demo banner** (`virtual:demo-banner`, `src/build-time/plugins/demo-banner/`). Full pattern and diagrams: **[docs/vue-plugin-architecture/README.md](../docs/vue-plugin-architecture/README.md)**. Step-by-step for a **second** plugin: **[Adding another build-swapped plugin](../docs/vue-plugin-architecture/README.md#adding-another-plugin)**.

## Project structure

> **Note:** We are currently migrating to a new component organization structure where each feature folder will contain a `__tests__` subdirectory alongside its related components. For example:
>
> ```
> pages/ComponentFolder/
> ├── __tests__/
> └── [related components]
> ```

## Internationalisation

UI strings are stored in CouchDB language documents and loaded at runtime via `src/i18n.ts` using [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/). The default English strings are seeded from `api/src/db/seedingDocs/lang-eng.json`.

See [docs/translations.md](../docs/translations.md) for details on:

- How to add or update translation strings
- Strings that contain named interpolation placeholders (`{variable}`)
- Strings that are shown only under specific UI conditions
- Strings reserved for future use

## Reading progress

The app tracks how far a user has read through article text and surfaces in-progress posts on the homepage **Continue Reading** row. Segment-based gates (visibility, skim detection, dwell time) ensure progress reflects actual reading, including long paragraphs on small screens.

Full design, diagrams, and constants: **[docs/reading-progress-tracker.md](../docs/reading-progress-tracker.md)**.

## Local setup

Refer to the [setup guide](../docs/setup-vue-app.md).

When running `npm run dev` the local reloading server of the app will start at http://localhost:4174.

## Query string parameters

The following query string parameters are supported:

- autoplay=true — Auto plays video when opening a post / tag with video content
- autofullscreen=true — Automatically switches to full screen video player mode on play

_Note: When navigating directly to a video post / tag URL, autoplay and autofullscreen will only work if playing without user interaction is enabled in the browser settings._

## Render state event

The app exposes a render lifecycle signal that external tooling (e.g. static site generation, pre-rendering, or integration tests) can hook into to know when the DOM is fully populated.

- A `data-render-state` attribute is set on `<html>` and updated as the state changes.
- A `render-state-change` `CustomEvent` is dispatched on `window` whenever the state changes. The new state is available on `event.detail`.

States:

- `loading` — the app is bootstrapping or the current page is still populating
- `ready` — the app has booted and the current page has finished populating the DOM
- `error` — the app failed to boot or the current page errored

Example consumer (e.g. a pre-render runner):

```js
if (document.documentElement.dataset.renderState === "ready") {
    // already done
} else {
    window.addEventListener("render-state-change", (e) => {
        if (e.detail === "ready") {
            // snapshot the DOM
        }
    });
}
```

Note: SSG / ISR is not part of the Luminary main project — this event is provided so implementers can build their own pre-rendering pipeline on top of it.

## Content freshness & the session clock

Content visibility queries filter on `publishDate` and `expiryDate` relative to "now" (see [`src/util/mangoIsPublished.ts`](src/util/mangoIsPublished.ts)). That "now" is **not** a live `Date.now()` — it is captured **once on page load** and held constant for the lifetime of the page via [`src/util/sessionNow.ts`](src/util/sessionNow.ts).

Why it's frozen: the publish/expiry bounds are embedded directly in the Mango query selector, and `HybridQuery` (in `luminary-shared`) uses the serialized selector as its reactive dedup key. A live clock changes the selector on every tick, so any reactive re-evaluation of a query during load would produce a new key, defeating the dedup and re-firing the API-supplement `POST`. Freezing "now" makes those selectors byte-stable, so a query only rebuilds when something _semantic_ changes. This mirrors `contentPublishDateCutoff`, which is likewise captured once at startup in [`src/main.ts`](src/main.ts).

**Trade-off (intentional):** in a long-lived session the bound does not advance, so content that crosses its publish or expiry boundary _after_ load only reflects on the next page load. For example, a "coming soon" tile whose `publishDate` passes while the tab stays open keeps rendering as coming-soon until reload. This is acceptable for authored content and PWAs reload often. If a long session ever needs to pick up scheduled transitions live, promote `sessionNow` to a `ref` ticked on a coarse interval (e.g. every few minutes) — every query referencing it then rebuilds _together_, once per tick, which still avoids the per-ref-change storm.

> Note: the "coming soon" badge styling on a content tile ([`src/components/content/ContentTile.vue`](src/components/content/ContentTile.vue)) is a render-time check using a live `Date.now()`, not a query, so it is unaffected by the frozen session clock.

## PWA install state & content sync tiering

How much content is pre-synced into IndexedDB depends on whether the app is running as an **installed PWA** (launched from the home-screen icon, in `display-mode: standalone`) or in a normal **browser tab**. The tier is decided **once per launch** in [`src/main.ts`](src/main.ts) from [`isInstalledStandalone()`](src/globalConfig.ts) (which checks the `standalone`/`minimal-ui`/`fullscreen` display modes and iOS `navigator.standalone`):

- **Installed (standalone):** no `publishDate` cutoff — the full corpus syncs for offline use.
- **Browser tab:** only the last ~1 month (`BROWSER_CONTENT_SYNC_WINDOW_MS`) is pre-synced; older content is fetched on demand by `HybridQuery` (see [`shared/src/util/HybridQuery/README.md`](../shared/src/util/HybridQuery/README.md)).

Because the tier is captured at startup (like the frozen session clock above), installing the app takes effect on the **next** launch.

### Matomo analytics

`initAnalytics()` ([`src/analytics.ts`](src/analytics.ts)) tags each Matomo session with its display mode (`installed` vs `browser`) so install adoption and its effect on the sync window can be measured.

To enable **per-pageview segmentation** in Matomo, create the custom dimension in Matomo admin and set `VITE_ANALYTICS_PWA_DIMENSION_ID` in the app's env. Until then the fallback `["trackEvent", "PWA", "displayMode", …]` event fires automatically — so the signal is captured either way, no config required to ship.

## Build for production

The web version of the app can be deployed as a Docker container by building the `Dockerfile`:

```sh
docker build -t luminary-app .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 luminary-app
```

`gzip` functionality is enabled by default; disable it as shown (available as a Docker `.env` parameter):

```sh
docker run -e ENABLE_GZIP=false --rm -it -p 8080:80 luminary-app
```

This will run the app on port 8080 on the host machine.
