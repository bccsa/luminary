# Luminary App

This is the frontend of the Luminary app. It's an offline-first Vue app that runs in the browser

## Local setup

Refer to the [setup guide](../docs/setup-vue-app.md).

When running `npm run dev` the local reloading server of the app will start at http://localhost:4174.

## Query string parameters

The following query string parameters are supported:

- autoplay=true - Auto plays video when opening a post / tag with video content
- autofullscreen=true - Automatically switches to full screen video player mode on play

_Note: When navigating directly to a video post / tag URL, autoplay and autofullscreen will only work if playing without user interaction is enabled in the browser settings._

## Plugins

Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of Luminary.

### How to add plugins

- To add a plugin you need to create a plugins folder, somewhere out of the project structure
- Set the VITE_PLUGIN_PATH env variable in your .env, then vite will go fetch your files at that location and copy it into the [plugins folder](./src/plugins/)

```
VITE_PLUGIN_PATH="../../plugins"
```

- To let luminary run the plugin you need to add a env variable VITE_PLUGINS to your env file and add an array of the plugins you want to add

```
VITE_PLUGINS=["examplePlugin", "examplePlugin2"]
```

- Every plugin class should have a constructor function

**The files is being copied every time before vite build, dev, and test is run**

### Plugin format

```ts
export class examplePlugin {
    constructor() {
        this.someFunction();
    }

    someFunction() {
        return "res";
    }
}
```

**Important that the filename and the class name is the same, and that the file is a ts file**

## Build for production

The web version of the app can be deployed as a Docker container by building the `Dockerfile`:

```sh
docker build -t luminary-app .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 luminary-app
```

`gzip` functionality is enabled by default, disable it as shown:
**It is available as a docker .env parameter**

```sh
docker run -e ENABLE_GZIP=false --rm -it -p 8080:80 luminary-app
```

This will run the app on port 8080 on the host machine.
